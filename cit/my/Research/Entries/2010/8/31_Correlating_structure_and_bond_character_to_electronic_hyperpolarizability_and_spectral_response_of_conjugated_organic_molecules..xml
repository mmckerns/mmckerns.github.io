    <richText>To a great extent, the structure-property relations for the linear polarizability and hyperpolarizabilities have been treated separately and as mostly unrelated. However, Gorman and Marder have recently shown that &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, and &#x3B3; of &#x3C0;-electron conjugated chain molecules can be correlated with the chemically relevant parameter bond length alternation (BLA), &#x3C0;-electron conjugated bond order alternation, or bridged-atomic charge sum (BACS). We will use quinoid-aromatic character (QAC), which provides a measure of the deviation from resonance bond length. By treating conjugated organic molecules as a mixture of two limiting resonance structures, one of which is neutral and the other of which exhibits a high degree of charge separation, it is possible to determine the molecular structure and, consequently, the polarizability of a molecule by examining the relative energetics of the two forms. The charge separated form can be stabilized by a combination of tuning the Coulomb potential of the end groups (i.e. the donor/acceptor strength), modifying the molecular topology (i.e. gain of aromatic charge stabilization energy upon charge separation), and changing the solvent-mediated polarization (i.e. more polar solvents stabilizing charge separation). Each of these forces has different local effects on the molecular and electronic structures; however, to a first-order approximation, these forces all correspond to an application of an effective electric field across a &#x3C0;-conjugated system. The effective field induces a charge separation and, thus, provides for a new equilibrium geometry and electronic configuration. This treatment allows the derivative relations, among static &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, and &#x3B3; (i.e. &#x3B1;(1), &#x3B1;(2), and &#x3B1;(3)) and the electric field E to be rewritten as a function of static electric perturbing field F, where the derivatives with respect to F are evaluated at the new equilibrium geometry.</richText>
