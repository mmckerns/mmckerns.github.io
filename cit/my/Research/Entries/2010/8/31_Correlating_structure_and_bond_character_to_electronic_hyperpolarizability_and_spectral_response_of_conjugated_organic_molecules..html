However, Gorman and Marder have recently shown that α, β, and γ of π-electron conjugated chain molecules can be correlated with the chemically relevant parameter bond length alternation (BLA), π-electron conjugated bond order alternation, or bridged-atomic charge sum (BACS). We will use quinoid-aromatic character (QAC), which provides a measure of the deviation from resonance bond length. By treating conjugated organic molecules as a mixture of two limiting resonance structures, one of which is neutral and the other of which exhibits a high degree of charge separation, it is possible to determine the molecular structure and, consequently, the polarizability of a molecule by examining the relative energetics of the two forms. The charge separated form can be stabilized by a combination of tuning the Coulomb potential of the end groups (i.e. the donor/acceptor strength), modifying the molecular topology (i.e. gain of aromatic charge stabilization energy upon charge separation), and changing the solvent-mediated polarization (i.e. more polar solvents stabilizing charge separation). Each of these forces has different local effects on the molecular and electronic structures; however, to a first-order approximation, these forces all correspond to an application of an effective electric field across a π-conjugated system. The effective field induces a charge separation and, thus, provides for a new equilibrium geometry and electronic configuration. This treatment allows the derivative relations, among static α, β, and γ (i.e. α<span class="style">(1)</span>, α<span class="style">(2)</span>, and α<span class="style">(3)</span>) and the electric field E to be rewritten as a function of static electric perturbing field F, where the derivatives with respect to F are evaluated at the new equilibrium geometry.</p>

The analysis began with the optimized structure of [C<span class="style_2">2</span>H<span class="style_2">2</span>-CdTXP]Cl, where a methanol molecule was placed axially above and below the molecular system and allowed to relax to lower energies. At a maximum gradient of 1.0 x 10<span class="style">-3</span> (with SCF convergence set at 1.0 x 10<span class="style">-6</span>), the chloride was not yet expelled from axial coordination; however, the molecule had become almost exactly planar, yielding a lower energy than the other two coordination structures presented above. The structure is very similar to the double-solvent-coordinated structures, with the major exception being that the chloride and a solvent molecule have been mutually substituted for each other. In this single-solvent-coordinated structure, the lone solvent molecule is nearly exactly arranged as in the double-solvent-coordinated case, whereas the other solvent molecule is hydrogen bonded through the oxygen to both the chloride ion and a dangling methyl group. Obviously, to fully be able to describe the relation between molecular structure and nonlinear response, this coordination environment needs to be explored in more detail in future research.<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">The present preliminary study suggests that structural modifications to the bridging macrocycle only strongly affect the hyperpolarizability of the R group. This limited range of effect is most likely due to a strong alternating bond step at the bridging nitrogens; therefore, to have the R group exert influence on the rest of the nitrogen cage, modification must be made to the structure that will soften this bond length character localized around the bridging nitrogens. Furthermore, it was determined that regardless of axial coordination (two opposing solvent molecules versus a single chloride counteranion), the bond character remains relatively unchanged for a moderate change in structure, with the only exception being the C-C-N-C-C bond sequence across the back of the nitrogen cage. This single feature, along with the addition of the solvent molecule in the calculation, is solely responsible for the increase in second-order hyperpolarizability of the series of MTXP molecules. More care needs be taken to separate these two effects; thus, a distinction must be made by either adding hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules to the metal-chlorine-bonded form or removing the solvent molecules for the TDHF calculation in the metal-solvent case.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">A further study attempting to relate spectral response with bond character was begun and showed some promising conclusions, even at a very early stage in its development. Preliminary ZINDO UV-vis results for [CdTXP]Cl showed separation of the MOs governing the spectral response into three distinct portions of the molecule. The Q-type band was governed by the bridging macrocycle; the B-type band was strongly affected by the opposite end of the MTXP molecule, with a small side peak possibly due to a coordinated solvent response; and a small side peak along the tail of the Q-type band appeared to be most strongly affected by modifications to the metal center. In the present study, a major approximation was made due to the unavailability of UV-vis spectral parameters for cadmium. To examine the spectral character, the cadmium metal center was replaced by zinc for all UV-vis calculations. However, this substitution is somewhat valid because the optimized geometry of the CdTXP molecule (at the 3-21G level) was frozen for the entirety of the ZINDO calculation, thus allowing for an approximation of the character of the CdTXP molecule to be determined. Although the calculated metal-governed peak is shifted toward much higher energies than the corresponding spectral peak, this calculated peak was seen to undergo a further hyperchromic shift when the above calculation was repeated with hydrogen as the metal center. This finding, in conjunction with the results of the above dilution study, indicates that the spectral behavior of the small peak on the side of the Q-type band may, indeed, be metal/solvent governed. Furthermore, stronger supporting evidence can be seen in analysis of the experimentally determined absorption spectra, in that substitution in the bridging macrocycle only strongly affects the Q-type band, whereas the B-type band is relatively unchanged. These results are very promising; however, a much more thorough study must be conducted before the preliminary conclusions can be confirmed.<br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Initially, a good approximation of the geometry of the metal-free TXP was obtained under semiempirical PM3 calculation (with the H-C-N-O molecular mechanics correction) in the MOPAC package. Then cadmium(II) was added as a metal center, a chloride atom was included to make the molecule charge neutral, and the geometry was resolved under the same considerations. The [CdTXP]Cl molecule was modified to create [PdTXP]Cl, [ZnTXP]Cl, [C<span class="style_2">2</span>H<span class="style_2">2</span>-CdTXP]Cl, [Np-CdTXP]Cl, [NO<span class="style_2">2</span>-CdTXP]Cl, [OCH<span class="style_2">3</span>-CdTXP]Cl, [(NC)<span class="style_2">2</span>C<span class="style_2">2</span>-CdTXP]Cl, and [InTXP]Cl<span class="style_2">2</span>, where all structures were optimized to SCF convergence of 1.0 x 10<span class="style">-8</span> (unless otherwise noted) at the 3-21G level in GAMESS. Structures calculated in this fashion were comparable to those found using X-ray diffraction. Calculations of static molecular polarizability and hyperpolarizability were then performed at the 3-21G level in GAMESS and compared to experimentally obtained DFWM values. The synchronization in trends of the zero-frequency 3-21G TDHF calculations with experimental data from DFWM is fair, where change in metal center provides the most disparity. It should be noted that an [MTXP]Cl molecule optimizes to a mostly planar geometry and that the use of different metal centers puckers the molecule, depending on metal size and coordination number. In the [InTXP]Cl<span class="style_2">2</span> molecule, the two opposing axially coordinated chloride counteranions appear to force planarity in the molecular nitrogen cage. Also, the bridging (benzo-) macrocycle can be seen to deviate rigidly from the molecular plane at an angle seemingly related to how the metal center fits into the molecular plane. The planarity of the molecule, however, was negligibly affected by substitution on the bridging group, for either substitution of a single atom (changing electronegativity) or extension of conjugation (as seen in the series of [C<span class="style_2">2</span>H<span class="style_2">2</span>-CdTXP]Cl, [CdTXP]Cl, and [Np-CdTXP]Cl molecules) through the bridging group. Static hyperpolarizabilities were recalculated at PM5 in MOPAC for the solved 3-21G geometries and compared to calculated bond character indicies. Little variation in the bond character was seen for a wide range of the present study’s structural modifications because the molecular structures optimized to a hybrid of the two conjugated forms (predominantly the bond-alternating form). This finding shows both that there is room for improvement in the hyperpolarizabilities of [MTXP]Cl complexes and that changing the bridging group is not the optimal way to better such a response.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">The above [MTXP]Cl geometries, however, may not be representative of the true MTXP geometries in solution due to the common use of coordinating solvents for measurement studies. These solvents may coordination bond axially to the metal center through their unpaired electrons and, thus, affect the molecular structure and bond character of the host MTXP molecule. This type of confirmation has been observed by Hannah et al in the solid-state structures of zinc and manganese metal-centered MTXP molecules. To test this coordination environment computationally, the chloride ion was replaced with two opposing solvent molecules (X=L<span class="style_2">2</span>; solvent L=chloroform, methanol, acetonitrile, or pyridine); then, the [MTXP]L<span class="style_2">2</span> molecule was reoptimized at the 3-21G level using GAMESS. Almost unanimously, the [MTXP]L<span class="style_2">2</span> molecules returned to a planar structure. Next, the chloride was reintroduced to the solvent-coordinated structure, and the geometry was reoptimized at the same level of theory. Only for the case where chloroform was used as the coordinating solvent did the chlorine atom expel one of the solvent molecules. Coordination bond strength (approximated through energy difference between optimized structures) was further found to increase from methanol to acetonitrile to pyridine. In all three cases, the chlorine counteranion was found to hydrogen bond to one of the solvent molecules, thus causing a slight skew in planarity for the MTXP molecule as a whole. For all of the [CdTXP]L<span class="style_2">2</span>Cl molecules, the bridging group was forced to tilt at an angle of less than 5<span class="style_3">°</span> due to the solvent molecules attempting to constrain the cadmium metal center to fit in a smaller nitrogen cage than cadmium would prefer, with the stronger (and larger) coordinating solvent causing less of a tilt angle for the bridging macrocycle. Interestingly, similar preliminary results were obtained for the planarity and bridging macrocycle tilt in the [PdTXP](MeOH)<span class="style_2">2</span>Cl molecule, although the non-solvent-coordinated structure of the [PdTXP]Cl molecule has a much stronger deviation from planarity. Further experimental support for this coordination environment was sought through examination of the linear absorption spectra of [CH<span class="style_2">3</span>-CdTXP]Cl in different solvents and, alternately, at different concentrations. A selection of concentrations of the same sample of [CH<span class="style_2">3</span>-CdTXP]Cl shows no peak shift or change in relative peak height when solvated in chloroform. However, the same sample in methanol was found to exhibit relative peak height shifts, especially noticeable in the peak centered near 700 nm. Also, a direct comparison of the same sample in different solutions shows more evidence of solvent coordination. Trends seen in peak shift and change in relative peak height follow increasing coordination potential with the metal center. Both of these observations lend credibility to the need for including coordinated solvent in the optimization of molecular geometry for MTXP molecules in solution.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">The solvent-coordinated structures (optimized at 3-21G) were then subjected to PM5 static hyperpolarizability calculation in MOPAC as done previously, and bond characteristics were recalculated. Here again, there was little variation of the bond character from one member of the study to the next; however, the standard deviation for the solvent-coordinated case was slightly larger. Only one feature of the molecule was substantially altered by allowing the solvent to coordinate; the C-C-N-C-C bond series that runs the length of all MTXP molecules became much less resonant in character across the back of the nitrogen cage, with the average QAC for that portion of the molecule increasing by an order of magnitude. Both the larger QAC and the larger deviation in bond character are most likely due to perturbation of symmetric structure by the coordinated solvent molecule and hydrogen-bound chloride. Furthermore, examination of the QAC for the R group and nitrogen cage for both the above-presented axial coordination environments reveals a strong direct trend in the second hyperpolarizability and the bond length character of the bridging macrocycle and no visible trend in for the QAC of the nitrogen cage. This finding suggests that structural modifications on MTXP molecules in the R group only strongly affect the hyperpolarizability of the R group.</p>
