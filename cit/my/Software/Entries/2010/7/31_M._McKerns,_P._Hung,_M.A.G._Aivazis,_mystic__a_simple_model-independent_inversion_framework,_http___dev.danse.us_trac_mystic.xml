    <richText>The mystic framework provides a collection of optimization algorithms and tools that lowers the barrier to solving complex optimization problems. Mystic provides a selection of optimizers, both global and local, including several gradient solvers. Every mystic optimizer provides the ability to apply bounds constraints generically and directly to the cost function, so that the difference in the speed of bounds-constrained optimization and unconstrained optimization is minimal.  Mystic also enables the user to impose an arbitrary parameter constraint function --- hence, non-bounds constraints can also be generically applied in any optimization problem. A unique and powerful feature of the framework is the ability to apply and configure solver-independent termination conditions --- a capability that greatly increases the flexibility for numerically solving problems with non-standard convergence profiles.&#xD;&#xD; All of mystic solvers conform to a solver API, thus also have common method calls to configure and launch an optimization job. This allows any of mystic&#x2019;s solvers to be easily swapped without the user having to write any new code. The API also makes it easy to bind a favorite 3rd party solver into the mystic framework. All optimizers included in mystic provide workflow at the fitting layer, not just access to the algorithms as function calls. Mystic gives the user fine-grained power to both monitor and steer optimizations as the fit processes are running. Wherever possible, mystic utilizes an extensible map algorithm that enables easy access to parallel and distributed computing.</richText>
