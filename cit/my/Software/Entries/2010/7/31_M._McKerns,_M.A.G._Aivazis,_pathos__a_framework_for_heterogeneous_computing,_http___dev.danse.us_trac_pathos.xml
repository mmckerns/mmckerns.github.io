    <richText>Modern calculations such as global optimizations and parameter sensitivity studies can require huge computational resources for all but the simplest of models. The need to prepare, schedule and monitor hundreds of runs and interactively explore and analyze data is a challenging problem. Managing such a complex computational environment requires a sophisticated software framework which can distribute the computation on remote nodes hiding the complexity of the communication in such a way that a scientist can concentrate on the details of computation. Pathos is a computational job management framework that offers a simple, efficient, and consistent user experience in a variety of heterogeneous environments from multi-core workstations to networks of large-scale computer clusters. Pathos provides a single environment for developing and testing algorithms locally -- and enables the user to execute the algorithms on remote clusters, while providing user full access to their job history. &#xD;&#xD;Pathos primarily provides the communication mechanisms for configuring and launching parallel computations across heterogenous resources. Pathos provides stagers and launchers for parallel and distributed computing, where each launcher contains the syntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an execution environment. Some examples of included launchers are: a queue-less MPI-based launcher, a ssh-based launcher, and a multiprocessing launcher. Pathos also provides a map-reduce algorithm for each of the available launchers, thus greatly lowering the barrier for users to extend their code to parallel and distributed resources. Pathos provides the ability to interact with batch schedulers and queuing systems, thus allowing large computations to be easily launched on high-performance computing resources. One of the most powerful features of pathos is "tunnel", which enables a user to automatically wrap any distributed service calls within a ssh-tunnel. Pathos also includes utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds, and a utility for the serialization of python objects.</richText>
