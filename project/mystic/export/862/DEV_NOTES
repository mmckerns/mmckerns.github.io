= THINGS TO RESOLVE =
mystic/mystic/differential_evolution.py:
 - allow register of sigint_callback for all 'one-liner' interfaces (?)
   . self._sigint_callback can be set from enable_signal_handler(callback)
   . merge enable & disable into signal_handler(status,callback) ?
mystic/mystic/_genSow.py
 - add ability to generate code for docstrings for the class methods

= UNTESTED/UNINTEGRATED STUFF =
[metropolis & support-vectors]
 - how to frame metropolis with solver.Solve()?
 - how to integrate support-vector tools with solver?

= OTHER NOTES =
mystic/helputil.py:
 - generic utility functions (non-essential)
 - the only one that is used is 'paginate' (in derun)
