This package contains the beginnings of a simple model-independent
inversion framework. The core optimizer is an implementation of the
Storn and Price differential evolution solver in python.

If 'pyina' is installed, the global optimizers can launched in parallel
mode using MPI. Pyina is part of the pathos package, available here:
